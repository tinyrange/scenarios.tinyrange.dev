Welcome to Day 2 of Scenario a Day.

Today I've implemented one of the simplest challenges. Find a file somewhere on the linux filesystem with a flag inside it.

Students are given access to a terminal and some basic instructions for navigating around the linux filesystem to find a file.

I've intentionally designed the challenge to resemble hide and seak to make it a bit more approuchable.
